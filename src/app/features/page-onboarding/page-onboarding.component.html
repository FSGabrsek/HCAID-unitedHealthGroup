        <p>Welcome to DividedHealthcare! We're here to help you find the insurance plan that's just right for you, because we believe that your health matters most.</p>
        <h2>Tailored Just for You</h2>
        <p>At DividedHealthcare, we understand that your health and insurance needs are unique. That's why we're committed to creating a personalized insurance plan that fits you like a glove. We'll ask you some questions to learn more about you and your health. The more we know, the better we can design a plan that suits you perfectly.</p>
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>You'll be asked some questions about your personal status, physical and mental health, and your medical history. These questions help us understand your needs and risks better. <span class="font_weight-semibold">Don't worry; all the questions are optional, and you're in control.</span> You can choose to answer as many or as few as you want.</p>
        <p>We recommend answering all the questions honestly and to the best of your ability. The more information you share, the more accurate and tailored your Personal Care plan will be. It's like giving us the pieces of the puzzle so we can create the full picture.</p>
        <h2>Prepare Your Medical Documents</h2>
        <p>If you have any medical documents, like past medical records, prescriptions, or test results, it's a good idea to have them handy. <span class="font_weight-semibold">This includes blood tests, ECG and fluoroscopy exams</span>. While they're not required, they can be very helpful in designing your plan.</p>
        <p>Remember, your health and well-being are our top priorities, and we're here to make sure you have the right insurance coverage for your needs. So, let's get started on the path to a healthier, more secure future together!</p>
